> *"We suffer more in imagination than in reality."* – Seneca  

Every day, without fail, I solve **one Medium-level problem** from the [NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice) sheet and commit my solution here.  
This is not just coding practice — it is a discipline.  
A daily exercise in patience, logic, and self-mastery.

- **Accept what I can’t:** Some days will be hard — I will still show up.  
- **Focus on virtue:** Code with clarity, purpose, and integrity.

## 📜 My Rules

- Commit the **same day** to maintain an unbroken chain.  
- Write **clean, well-commented, and efficient** C++ solutions.  
- Let progress be steady, not rushed.
